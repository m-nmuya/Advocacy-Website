      <h2>Nice to meet you! We are Hoover Girls Code!</h2>
        <p>
          We plan frequent virtual girls code nights to learn, have fun, and code! Along with this, we serve as female tech ambassadors to many STEM events around Hoover. You'll find us at Bluff Park, Rocky Ridge, Trace Crossings, and many other places around Alabama.

        <p>WHAT HAVE WE DONE IN THE PAST? Coding Sessions at Hoover High School We taught younger girls the basics of algorithms.We engaged them in a game where one person was blindfolded and someone else told them to either go left, right, backwards, or straight. This experience allows these younger girls to get firsthand experience as to how algorithms help robots function properly.</p>
        <p>We taught them how to use microbit, which is a device that has LED lights and two programmable buttons that can be used in game-play.</p>
        <p>Bluff Park Elementary Hour of Code Assisted with STEM day and had fun with the kids! </p>
        <p>GEMS (Girls Engaged in Math and Science) Expo at Rocky Ridge Elementary School Taught girls about cryptography (encryption & decryption)!</p>
